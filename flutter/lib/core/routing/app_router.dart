/// Builds the app's [GoRouter].
///
/// go_router sits on Navigator 2.0, which is what lets a conversation be
/// addressed by URL: `/contacts/c1` resolves the same whether it was reached by
/// tapping a card or restored from a cold start.
///
/// The six top-level destinations live inside a [ShellRoute], so [AppShell] —
/// and with it the bottom bar or the tablet sidebar — is built once and stays
/// mounted while only the page underneath changes. Each of those pages is a
/// [NoTransitionPage], so switching tabs swaps the content with no slide and no
/// fade: the navigation is furniture, not something that should move.
///
/// The conversation screen sits *outside* the shell, on the root navigator, so
/// it covers the bar the way a drill-down should and keeps a normal push
/// animation and back-swipe.
///
/// Welcome, sign in and sign up sit outside the shell too, ahead of it: they
/// are the app's cold-start flow, not a tab a user switches back to.
///
/// Appointments, Medicines and Memories are Rehman's screens, merged in from
/// his branch.
